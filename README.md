# binstall

**Minimal Bash-based installers for popular CLI tools from GitHub releases.**  
No package managers, no bloatâ€”just copy, paste, and run.

## ðŸš€ Why?

This project provides simple and portable Bash scripts to install the latest versions of CLI tools directly from their GitHub releases.

- âœ… Zero dependencies (just `bash`, `curl`, `jq`, and `tar`)
- âœ… Works on any modern Linux (and macOS with tweaks)
- âœ… Easy to read and customize
- âœ… Great for scripts, containers, or minimal systems

## ðŸ“¦ Available Tools

| Tool | Install Script | Setup Docs |
|------|----------------|------------|
| [k6](k6/) | [install.sh](k6/install.sh) | â€“ |

## ðŸ›  Usage

To install `k6`, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbehzadan/binstall/main/k6/install.sh | bash
````

Or visit the tool's folder for more details and a copy-pasteable version: [k6/README.md](k6/README.md)
